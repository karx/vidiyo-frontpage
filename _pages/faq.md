## FAQs
##### My celebrity is not on Vidiyo yet, what do I do?
Don’t worry, we’re on it. Every day our team is reaching out to hundreds of celebrities, from musicians to actors, media personalities to sports stars. Our goal: “if they’re famous, they’re here.” In the meantime, invite your favourite celeb to join! Make your voice heard, Tweet out an invite!


##### How does my celebrity make my video?
All celebrity members have access to the exclusive celebrity section of the Vidiyo.me iPhone and Android app which notifies them of incoming video requests and helps them to record your custom message. If your video-request is reviewed, approved, and then recorded, your hearts are charged for the initially agreed-upon amount.


##### What happens if my video request is rejected?
You will receive an email with your celebrity’s reason for rejection. You may re-submit another request if you so choose. Celebrity encourages positive, light-hearted messages. Celebrities reserve the right to choose what they will record.


##### How long does it take?
Depends. Some celebrities will respond immediately, others may take longer. Typically, a request should be returned within 2 weeks.


##### How do I know I’ll get my video?

##### Is my Vidiyo's public?
If you’d like them to be, you can select yours to be shared on the official Vidiyo.me, YouTube channel as well as within the app. Or, you can decide to keep your private and just between you and your celebrity.
